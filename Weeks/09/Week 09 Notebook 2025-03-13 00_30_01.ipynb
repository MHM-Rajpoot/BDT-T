Ironically, Ray's initial introduction to Martha was as a prospective mark. But when they met, it was love at first sight, perhaps as a result of their penchant for kinky sex and their mutual love for duplicity and easy money. With Martha posing as Ray's sister, they bilked elderly spinsters and widows of their savings and then viciously murdered them in a bloodbath of sexual frenzy. When they were arrested, Martha and Ray confessed to 12 killings, although it is believed the actual number is closer to 20. At their sensational trial, Martha and Ray cooed, held hands and seemed as though they could not get enough of each other. Their plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was rejected, and on August 22, 1949, the homicidal lovers were sentenced to death. After numerous appeals, they were electrocuted on March 8, 1951, side-by-side in Sing Sing prison.\",\n","    \"languages\": [\n","      \"English\"\n","    ],\n","    \"released\": {\n","      \"$date\": 1161388800000\n","    },\n","    \"directors\": [\n","      \"Todd Robinson\"\n","    ],\n","    \"writers\": [\n","      \"Todd Robinson\"\n","    ],\n","    \"awards\": {\n","      \"wins\": 0,\n","      \"nominations\": 1,\n","      \"text\": \"1 nomination.\"\n","    },\n","    \"lastupdated\": \"2015-08-28 00:31:01.910000000\",\n","    \"year\": 2006,\n","    \"imdb\": {\n","      \"rating\": 6.5,\n","      \"votes\": 16744,\n","      \"id\": 441774\n","    },\n","    \"countries\": [\n","      \"Germany\",\n","      \"USA\"\n","    ],\n","    \"type\": \"movie\",\n","    \"tomatoes\": {\n","      \"website\": \"http://www.cstar.com/lonelyhearts/\",\n","      \"viewer\": {\n","        \"rating\": 3.2,\n","        \"numReviews\": 9726,\n","        \"meter\": 49\n","      },\n","      \"dvd\": {\n","        \"$date\": 1185840000000\n","      },\n","      \"critic\": {\n","        \"rating\": 5.6,\n","        \"numReviews\": 42,\n","        \"meter\": 48\n","      },\n","      \"boxOffice\": \"$0.1M\",\n","      \"consensus\": \"Several genres and plotlines intertwine in Lonely Hearts but don't connect, creating an uneven and unsatisfying film.\",\n","      \"rotten\": 22,\n","      \"production\": \"Samuel Goldwyn/Roadside\",\n","      \"lastUpdated\": {\n","        \"$date\": 1440011573000\n","      },\n","      \"fresh\": 20\n","    },\n","    \"num_mflix_comments\": 0\n","  },\n","  {\n","    \"_id\": {\n","      \"$oid\": \"573a13b3f29313caabd3dccc\"\n","    },\n","    \"plot\": \"The events leading up to the sword fighting cat's meeting with Shrek and his friends.\",\n","    \"genres\": [\n","      \"Animation\",\n","      \"Adventure\",\n","      \"Comedy\"\n","    ],\n","    \"runtime\": 90,\n","    \"metacritic\": 65,\n","    \"rated\": \"PG\",\n","    \"cast\": [\n","      \"Antonio Banderas\",\n","      \"Salma Hayek\",\n","      \"Zach Galifianakis\",\n","      \"Billy Bob Thornton\"\n","    ],\n","    \"poster\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMTU5MTY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgyNjg2NQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg\",\n","    \"title\": \"Puss in Boots\",\n","    \"fullplot\": \"Years before meeting Shrek and Donkey, the adorable but tricky Puss in Boots must clear his name from all charges making him a wanted fugitive.
