Data Sources:  
- User activity logs (song plays, skips, likes, dislikes)  
- Metadata (song title, artist, genre, duration)  
- User demographics and profile preferences  
- Social interactions (shared playlists, friend activity)  


2.
Batch / Stream Processing:  
- Stream Processing: Real-time tracking of user interactions (e.g., song plays, skips, likes) to provide immediate recommendations.  
- Batch Processing: Periodic analysis of historical user data to refine long-term music preference models.  


3.
What Data Processing Might Be Required:  
- Data cleaning and normalization (handling missing values, standardizing formats)  
- Feature extraction (e.g., most played songs, genres, time-of-day preferences)  
- Machine learning for personalized recommendations  
- Sentiment analysis on user feedback  


4.
How Could Data Be Persisted or Used:  
- Databases: Store structured user and song metadata (SQL or NoSQL)  
- Data Lakes: Store raw historical user interaction data for batch analysis  
- Real-time Storage: Use caching solutions (e.g., Redis) for fast recommendation retrieval  
- Usage:  
  - Personalized playlist recommendations  
  - User engagement analytics and insights  
  - Adaptive streaming quality based on usage patterns
